# Experiments on Eigenvalue Problems

This repository contains implementations of several eigensolvers in MATLABÂ®:

1. `qrstandard.m`: QR algorithm for standard eigenvalue problems,
2. `qzgeneralized.m`: QZ algorithm for generalized eigenvalue problems,
3. `qzperiodic.m`: Periodic QZ algorithm for generalized eigenvalue problems.

Also, numerical experiments on these algorithms are the following three files: `experiments_qrstandard.m`, `experiments_qzgeneralized.m` and `experiments_qzperiodic.m`. All of the works are finished in Undergraduate Seminar on Numerical Linear Algebra 2018, Fudan University.
